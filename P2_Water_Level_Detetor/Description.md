# ESP32 Water Level Controller System

## üåä Project Overview
This project implements an advanced water level monitoring and control system using an ESP32 microcontroller. The system monitors water levels using an ultrasonic sensor, automatically controls a water pump based on configurable thresholds, and provides multiple communication interfaces for monitoring and control.

## üíß Features

### Core Functionality
- **Automatic Water Level Control**: Automatically operates a water pump to maintain water levels between configurable thresholds
- **Real-time Water Level Monitoring**: Uses ultrasonic sensor technology for accurate, non-contact level measurement
- **LCD Display**: Provides visual feedback showing current water level, percentage full, and system status
- **Configurable Thresholds**: User-adjustable thresholds for pump operation, warnings, and critical alerts
- **Status Indicators**: RGB LED and buzzer for visual and audible status alerts

### Advanced Features
- **Bluetooth Interface**: Configure and monitor the system remotely via Bluetooth using simple text commands
- **WiFi Connectivity**: Optional WiFi connectivity for remote monitoring and integration with home automation systems
- **Motor Safety Protection**: Prevents motor damage with runtime limitations and cooldown periods
- **Persistent Settings**: Stores configuration in non-volatile memory, surviving power outages
- **System Statistics**: Tracks and reports motor runtime, cycles, average water levels, and more
- **Manual Override**: Switch between automatic and manual operation modes

1. Install the Arduino IDE (2.0+ recommended)
2. Install ESP32 board support in Arduino IDE:
   - Go to File > Preferences
   - Add `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/espressif/arduino-esp32/gh-pages/package_esp32_index.json` to Additional Board Manager URLs
   - Go to Tools > Board > Boards Manager and install "ESP32 by Espressif Systems"
3. Install required libraries:
   - LiquidCrystal
   - Preferences (included with ESP32 board package)
4. Configure your WiFi credentials in the code (optional)
5. Upload the sketch to your ESP32

## üî§ Bluetooth Commands

Connect to "ESP32_WaterController" via Bluetooth using a serial terminal app and send these commands:

| Command        | Description                                          |
|----------------|------------------------------------------------------|
| `status`       | Show current system status                           |
| `motoron`      | Turn motor ON manually                               |
| `motoroff`     | Turn motor OFF manually                              |
| `auto`         | Return to automatic control mode                     |
| `set:param:value` | Set parameters (see below)                        |
| `reset`        | Reset all settings to default values                 |
| `stats`        | Show system statistics                               |
| `help`         | Display available commands                           |

### Configurable Parameters (with `set:` command):
- `high`: High level threshold (motor OFF point)
- `low`: Low level threshold (motor ON point)
- `warning`: Warning level threshold
- `critical`: Critical level threshold
- `height`: Tank height in cm
- `capacity`: Tank capacity in liters

**Example:** `set:low:60` sets the low water threshold to 60cm

## üìê System Configuration

### Default Settings
- Tank Height: 200 cm
- Tank Capacity: 20 liters
- Low Level Threshold (motor OFF): 150 cm
- High Level Threshold (motor ON): 50 cm
- Warning Level: 160 cm
- Critical Level: 180 cm

The system measures distance from the sensor to the water surface. A **smaller** distance value indicates a **higher** water level.

## üõ°Ô∏è Safety Features
- **Motor Runtime Protection**: Automatically shuts off the pump after 5 minutes of continuous operation
- **Motor Cooldown Period**: Enforces a 1-minute cooldown period after maximum runtime
- **Threshold Constraints**: Prevents invalid configurations
- **Alert System**: Visual and audible notifications for low water conditions
- **Watchdog Timer**: ESP32's built-in watchdog timer prevents system hangs

## üîç Monitoring System Status

### LCD Display
The LCD shows:
- Current water level in liters
- Tank percentage full
- System status (Normal, Warning, Critical)
- Motor status (ON/OFF) or Manual mode indication

### RGB LED Indicators
- **Green**: System normal
- **Yellow**: Warning level reached
- **Red**: Critical water level
- **Blue**: Motor is running

### Buzzer Alerts
- **No Sound**: Normal operation
- **Intermittent Beep**: Warning level reached
- **Continuous Beep**: Critical water level

## üì± Mobile Monitoring
The system sends regular updates via Bluetooth that can be received and processed by a compatible mobile app. The data format is:
```
UPDATE|distance|liters|percent|motorStatus|systemStatus
```

Example: `UPDATE|45|16|80|OFF|NORMAL`

## üîå Power Requirements
- Operating Voltage: 5V DC
- Current Draw: ~200mA (excluding pump)
- Recommended power supply: 5V 2A power adapter or USB power bank for the ESP32
- The water pump should have a separate power supply appropriate for its specifications

## üìà Future Enhancements
- Web interface for remote management
- Cloud connectivity for remote monitoring
- Historical data logging and trend analysis
- Integration with Home Assistant, Google Home, or Amazon Alexa
- Multiple sensor support for large or complex tanks
- Mobile app development
- Flow meter integration to track water consumption

## üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting

| Problem | Possible Solution |
|---------|------------------|
| Erratic sensor readings | Check sensor positioning, ensure it's perpendicular to water surface |
| Motor not activating | Check relay connections and thresholds configuration |
| LCD not displaying | Check I2C connections and address setting |
| System restarting | Ensure power supply is adequate (2A+ recommended) |
| WiFi not connecting | Check credentials and signal strength |
