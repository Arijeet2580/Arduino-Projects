# 🔥 Smart Gas Leak Detection System with Auto-Ventilation & Debug Mode

## 🚀 Project Overview

This is a **Smart LPG Gas Detection and Control System** built using Arduino. The system continuously monitors LPG gas concentration using the **MQ-5 sensor**, calculates PPM, and responds intelligently through a combination of:

- Visual and audio alerts
- Automated servo-controlled window ventilation
- Real-time Bluetooth communication
- LCD display with live status
- EEPROM storage for persistent settings
- Debug mode for diagnostics and live system metrics

Designed to respond to **three states** (Normal, Warning, Danger), the system improves household safety with **minimal manual intervention**.

## 🌟 Future Enhancements

> These are planned features or suggested upgrades to improve system performance and reliability:

1. **📉 Temperature Compensation**
   Integrate DHT22 to correct gas sensor drift due to ambient changes.

2. **🕒 RTC Module Integration (DS3231)**
   Add real-time timestamps for logs and alarms.

3. **💾 SD Card or External EEPROM Logging**
   Enable persistent data logging for post-incident review.

4. **📡 ESP32 Migration**
   Enable OTA firmware updates and Wi-Fi dashboard for remote access.

5. **📊 Web Dashboard**
   Serve gas readings, stats, and logs over a local web server.

6. **🧠 Adaptive Thresholding**
   Implement long-term baseline learning to adapt to environment.

7. **🔋 Battery Monitoring**
   Monitor Li-Ion voltage and alert for low battery.

8. **⚠️ Sensor Fault Detection**
   Alert on disconnection or abnormal readings (<10 or >1000 ADC).

9. **🛡️ Anti-Tamper Mechanism**

## 🧪 Calibration Instructions

1. Power on the system in clean air.
2. Send `calibrate` via Bluetooth or serial.
3. Follow on-screen instructions (10-second sampling).
4. New calibration factor is auto-saved to EEPROM.
