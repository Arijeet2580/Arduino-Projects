# 2️⃣ Water Level Detector

This project  Ultrasonic sensor is used to detect the water level in the tank. This project prevents the overflow of water from the tank.It has a range of real life applications such as in the water tank of our house, in the water tank of our car, etc. 

* If the Water level is below Threshold value then the motor will turn On 
* If the water level is above the threshold value then the motor will turn Off.
 * The Turn On and Turn Off of the motor is indicated by the led.
